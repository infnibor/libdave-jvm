# Security Advisories

This directory contains an archive of security advisories relating to BoringSSL.
Some come from BoringSSL directly, while others are the BoringSSL counterparts
to OpenSSL advisories, detailing how they impact BoringSSL. In case of OpenSSL
advisories, even when the advisory does not impact BoringSSL, we will publish a
corresponding document saying so.

TODO(crbug.com/479225940): Publish historical advisories.
