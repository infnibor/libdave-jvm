## `ASN1_TYPE` Type Confusion
Several issues in this advisory are due to the OpenSSL `ASN1_TYPE` structure, which represents an ASN.1 ANY value. The `ASN1_TYPE` structure contains a C `union`. All accesses must take care to check the type field before accessing the `union`.

While BoringSSL was not affected by any of the type confusion issues, it does share the `ASN1_TYPE` structure itself. The `ASN1_TYPE` structure is part of OpenSSL’s public API and embedded in many parts of the library. As part of triaging this advisory, we audited accesses to `ASN1_TYPE` within the library and found no instances of type confusion.
